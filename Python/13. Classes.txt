Creating a new class creates a new type of object, a means of bundling data and functionality together.
# Basic Syntax
	class Class_Name:
		"A doc string here"	-> Obtained by using x.__doc__
		var = value			-> Class variables common for all
		def __init__(self,vars):	-> Runs initially after declaring the class
			self.vari = []		-> Instance Variables different for all
		def other_func(self):
			Execute_statement

# Inheritance
	class DerivedClassName(BaseClassName):	-> Could be multiple base classes
		statements_execution

	isinstance(obj,base), issubclass(c1,c2)	-> Checking if it is a derived-class or sub-class
