Creating a new class creates a new type of object, a means of bundling data and functionality together.
-> Absraction(Hiding), Encapsulation(Combined), Inheritance(Inherit_features), Polymorphism(Multiple_forms)

# Basic Syntax
	class Class_Name():
		"A doc string here"	-> Obtained by using x.__doc__

		var = value			-> Class variables common for all

		def __init__(self,vars):	-> Runs initially after declaring the class *[Constructor]*
			self.vari = []		-> Instance Variables different for all

		def other_func(self):
			Execute_statement

		Class_Name.database.append(self)	-> Creates a database of class

	-> Some more Dunder functions
		def __repr__(self):
			return string_format	-> Represents in this format when print is used
		def __str__(self):	-> Representation foormat when str() is used
