One function name can have different functionality for different kinds

# Polymorphism -> Operators, Function, Class level
	Operator Level => Different functionalities using +,-,*,=
			   => Joining lists, strings etc.

	Function Level => len() works different to calculate number_of_elements for list,string,dictionary etc.
			   => args & kwargs is working for different number of arguments

	Class Level    => Same function defined for different classes behave differently
			   => Different animals having different results for speak()
			   => Can be done using multiple defined classes having function with same name
			   => Could be done by overwriting in Inheritance
