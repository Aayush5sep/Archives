# Inheritance
	class DerivedClassName(BaseClassName):	-> Could be multiple base classes
		statements_execution
	
	-> Multi-Level Inheritance & Multiple Inheritance both can be done

	-> isinstance(obj,base), issubclass(c1,c2)	-> Checks if it is a derived-class or sub-class

# Additional Attributes And Super(For Reconstruction)
	def __init__(self,vars):
		additional_statements
		super().FunctionName(varis)	-> Super is used to call BaseClassFunctions(e.g. __init__)
							-> Parent function is overwritten when re-initialized

# Method Resolution Order (MRO)
	-> All classes are inherited from object-class which contains __init__ , __new__ & more
	-> __new__ method runs first secretly which allocates memory
	-> In multiple inheritance with common base_class_functions, the first inherited class is preferred
		class_name.mro()	to check preference order
