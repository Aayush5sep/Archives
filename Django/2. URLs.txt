from django.urls import include, path
urlpatterns = [
	path('', views.index, name='index'),	-> Simple url to map to a view function to execute
	path('url/', include('app_name.urls')),	-> Map to another url.py file
	path('dynamicurl/<datatype:variable_name>', views.function), ]	-> Variable data in the url

Patterns donâ€™t search GET and POST parameters, or the domain name.
	domain/myapp/  and domain/myapp/?page=4  both will look for only myapp/
