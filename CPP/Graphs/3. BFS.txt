# Breadth First Search => Level Wise Traversal

	=> Starting Node is the 0th level
	=> Distance from the starting node is the level of that node

# Applying BFS
	
	=> starting_node, visited_array, queue(first-in-first-out)
	=> Push starting_node into queue & mark as visited
	=> Pull out from queue, mark as visited & push its unvisited-neighbours into queue
	=> Store this pushed out element from queue in a list
	=> Repeat this until the queue is empty
	=> Our list is the bfs traversal result
