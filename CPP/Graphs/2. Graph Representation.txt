# Representation Of Graph In C++

	Input => 	n(vertices) 
			m(edges) 
			m_number_of_lines(a & b edge between node)

	1> Adjacency Matrix
		=> adj[n+1][n+1]
		=> adj[a][b] = 1
		=> adj[b][a] = 1 for undirected graphs
		=> adj[a][b] = weight for weighted graphs

	2> Adjacency List
		=> vector<int> adj[n+1]
		=> adj[a].push_back(b)
		=> adj[b].push_back(a) for undirected graphs
		=> pair<int> to be stored for weighted graphs
