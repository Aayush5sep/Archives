# Graphs
	=> Directed Graph/Unidirectional
	=> Undirected Graph/Bidirectional

	=> Cyclic [start at same node & end at same node]
	=> Acyclic

# Path => Contain a lot of nodes, no node is repeated & each of them are reachable

# Degree Of A Node => Number of nodes attached to the node
	=> Total degree of graph = 2*Total number of edges
	=> Indegree is poiniting towards node 
	=> Outdegree is pointing away from node

# Weighted Graph => Weight is assigned to each edge

# Connected Components
	=> A graph can have components which are not connected to each other by some edge
	=> For Traversal, visited array is used to go for every unvisited edge
