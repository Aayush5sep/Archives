			|-----> Regression
# Supervised ML --|	
		    	|-----> Classification

	=> Supervised ML includes mapping of input attributes to create an almost-fit model
		Both Independent & Dependent Features are in the input attributes
		Using the trained model, O/P(dep.feature) is predicted by input(indep.features)

	=> Regression problem includes continuous variable functions when trying to find output
	=> Classification problem however have fixed number of output categories

				|------> Clustering
# Unsupervised ML ------|
				|------> Dimensionality Reduction

	=> Unsupervised ML does not contain any dependent features/variable
		Assumptions are therfore made based on the independent input data

	=> Clustering is segmenting users into different groups based on their attributes
	=> DR is used to reduce/lower_down/combine a high number of features into small number of features
